# Mandatum — Multi-Agent Task Tracker

A self-contained task tracking system for coordinating AI agents. Exposes a full MCP server over HTTP/SSE so multiple AI agents can connect simultaneously and coordinate work via a shared kanban board.

```

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** toolchain (stable) — install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs):
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  source $HOME/.cargo/env
  ```
- **Node.js 18+** and npm — install via [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or `nvm`:
  ```bash
  nvm install 20 && nvm use 20
  ```

## Installation

Clone the repo (if you haven't already) and install UI dependencies:

```bash
cd ui && npm install && cd ..
```

That's it — the Rust dependencies are fetched automatically on first `cargo build` or `cargo run`.

In the **project repo** that agents will work on, add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` so agent working directories are not committed:

```bash
echo '.worktrees/' >> /path/to/your/project/.gitignore
```

## Running in Development

### Option A — one command (recommended)

```bash
make dev
```

This starts both servers concurrently and prefixes their output with `[server]` / `[ui]`.
Press **Ctrl-C** to stop both.

### Option B — two terminals

```bash
# Terminal 1: Rust server (REST API on :3001, MCP on :3002)
cd server && cargo run

# Terminal 2: React UI dev server on :5173
cd ui && npm run dev
```

Once running, open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

> **First run note:** `cargo run` will compile all Rust dependencies, which takes 1–2 minutes. Subsequent runs are instant.

## Running Autonomous Agents

Agents are Claude Code instances running in non-interactive (`--print`) mode, looped by shell scripts. After completing a task they restart automatically rather than waiting for user input.

### Prerequisites

- `claude` CLI on your `PATH` — install via [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)
- The Mandatum server must be running (`make dev` or `cargo run`)
- The project the agents will work on must be a git repository

### Quickstart

```bash
# From inside your project repo — launch one of each agent type
make -C /path/to/mandatum agents PROJECT_DIR=$(pwd)

# Or use the script directly
/path/to/mandatum/agents/run-all.sh /path/to/your/project
```

Press **Ctrl-C** to stop all agents cleanly.

### Running individual agents

Each role has its own script. All accept an optional agent ID and project directory:

```bash
# Usage: run-<role>.sh [agent-id] [project-dir]
# PROJECT_DIR env var is also accepted.

/path/to/mandatum/agents/run-coder.sh    coder-alpha   /path/to/project
/path/to/mandatum/agents/run-reviewer.sh reviewer-1    /path/to/project
/path/to/mandatum/agents/run-tester.sh   tester-1      /path/to/project
/path/to/mandatum/agents/run-docs.sh     docs-1        /path/to/project
```

Run multiple coders in parallel by opening separate terminals with different agent IDs:

```bash
# Terminal 1
run-coder.sh coder-alpha /path/to/project

# Terminal 2
run-coder.sh coder-beta /path/to/project
```

### Project directory vs Mandatum directory

The scripts separate two concerns:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Mandatum directory | Where the tracker server lives (`make dev`, `tasks.db`) |
| Project directory | The git repo agents check out branches and commit code into |

The MCP config path is always resolved relative to the `agents/` folder regardless of where you invoke the script from. The `claude` process runs with its cwd set to your project directory so all git operations land in the right repo.

### How the loop works

Each script runs `claude --print "<system-prompt>"` in a shell loop:

```
claude --print "..." → agent runs, completes task, exits
        ↓ (10s pause)
claude --print "..." → agent picks up next task
        ↓
        ...
```

If an agent's tokens are exhausted mid-task, the process exits and the loop restarts after 10 seconds. The server's watchdog will reap the stuck task back to `backlog` within 10 minutes so another agent (or the restarted one) can claim it.

### Stale agent detection

The server automatically resets `in_progress` tasks whose assigned agent hasn't sent a heartbeat in **10 minutes**, moving them back to `backlog`. You can also trigger this manually:

```bash
# Reap all stale tasks at once
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/reap

# Reset a specific task
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/<task-id>/reset
```

The UI shows a ⚠ warning on any task card whose agent is stale, and a **Reset** button inside the task modal.

---

## Seeding Sample Data

With the servers running, populate the board with realistic tasks and agents:

```bash
make seed
# or directly:
cd server && bash seed.sh
```

This inserts 8 tasks spread across multiple statuses and priorities, and registers 5 agents (2 coders, 1 reviewer, 1 tester, 1 docs writer). Refresh the UI to see them appear.

## Build for Production

```bash
make build
```

Produces:
- `server/target/release/mandatum-server` — standalone server binary
- `ui/dist/` — static React app

### Single-process deployment (recommended)

The server serves the React app directly — no separate web server needed:

```bash
# Build everything and start as a single process
make serve

# Or manually:
./server/target/release/mandatum-server --ui ui/dist
```

Open **http://localhost:3001** — the same port serves both the API and the UI.

The server auto-detects `ui/dist` if it exists in the current directory, so running `./mandatum-server` from the repo root after `make build` just works without `--ui`.

### Custom paths and ports

```bash
./mandatum-server --ui /var/www/mandatum \
                  --db /var/data/tasks.db \
                  --rest-port 8080 \
                  --mcp-port 8081
```

Run `./mandatum-server --help` for all options.

## Git Workflow

Each task maps to a git branch. The full lifecycle:

```
backlog → [coder claims] → in_progress → [coder requests review] → in_review
       → [reviewer approves] → testing → [tester passes] → docs_needed
       → [docs writer] → done
```

### Step-by-step

**Coder**
```
1. get_next_task          → returns task + suggested branch name
2. setup_worktree         → records worktree path; returns git worktree add commands
   git worktree add .worktrees/<branch> -b <branch>
   cd .worktrees/<branch>
   (OR: git checkout -b <branch> if working in a single checkout)
3. create_branch          → records branch in tracker (if not using setup_worktree)
4. ... write code ...
5. git add . && git commit -m "feat: implement X"
6. record_commit          → records hash + message in tracker
7. (repeat 5–6 as needed)
8. request_review         → moves to in_review, returns reviewer checkout commands
9. set_pr_url             → optional, if you opened a GitHub/GitLab PR
```

**Reviewer**
```
1. get_next_task          → picks from in_review
2. get_review_target      → returns branch name + all commits + git commands
3. setup_worktree         → create an isolated worktree for reviewing
   git worktree add .worktrees/<branch>-review <branch>
   cd .worktrees/<branch>-review
4. git diff main --stat   → inspect changes
5. add_task_comment       → log review notes
6. approve_review         → moves to testing
   OR request_changes     → moves back to in_progress with feedback
7. git worktree remove .worktrees/<branch>-review  → clean up when done
```

**Tester**
```
1. get_next_task          → picks from testing
2. setup_worktree         → create isolated worktree for testing
   git worktree add .worktrees/<branch>-test <branch>
   cd .worktrees/<branch>-test
3. ... run tests ...
4. record_commit          → record any test commits
5. update_task_status     → "docs_needed" (pass) or "in_progress" (fail with note)
6. git worktree remove .worktrees/<branch>-test  → clean up when done
```

**Docs Writer**
```
1. get_next_task          → picks from docs_needed
2. setup_worktree         → create isolated worktree for docs
   git worktree add .worktrees/<branch>-docs <branch>
   cd .worktrees/<branch>-docs
3. ... write docs ...
4. record_commit          → record docs commit
5. set_output_path        → record docs file path
6. update_task_status     → "done"
7. git worktree remove .worktrees/<branch>-docs  → clean up when done
```

### Branch naming

`get_next_task` suggests a branch name automatically:
```
feature/<first-8-chars-of-task-id>-<slugified-title>
```
e.g. `feature/a1b2c3d4-implement-user-authentication`

### Git worktrees — multiple agents on the same machine

Git worktrees let multiple agents work on different branches **simultaneously** from one repository clone. Each worktree is a separate directory with its own working tree and index, but they all share the same `.git` object store — so no duplication of history.

```bash
# Coder sets up their worktree
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-a1b2c3d4-add-auth -b feature/a1b2c3d4-add-auth

# Reviewer checks out concurrently in a separate worktree
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-a1b2c3d4-add-auth-review feature/a1b2c3d4-add-auth

# List all active worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove when done
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-a1b2c3d4-add-auth-review
```

The tracker records each agent's `worktree_path` so the UI shows exactly where each agent is working. Add `.worktrees/` to your `.gitignore`.

## Connecting AI Agents via MCP

### MCP Configuration

Add this to your Claude Desktop or Claude Code MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-tracker": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3002/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

For Claude Code CLI:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http task-tracker http://localhost:3002
```

### Using the runner scripts (recommended)

The `agents/` directory contains pre-configured runner scripts that handle the MCP connection automatically. See [Running Autonomous Agents](#running-autonomous-agents) above — no manual MCP config needed.

### Multiple Agents Simultaneously

Each agent connects independently over SSE. The server supports unlimited concurrent MCP connections. Simply configure multiple Claude instances with the same MCP URL — each will get its own SSE stream.

---

## MCP Tools Reference

### `register_agent`
Register an agent so it appears in the system and agent panel.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "role": "coder"
}
```

### `get_next_task`
Claim the next available task for your role (priority-ordered). Atomically assigns the task and moves it to `in_progress`.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "role": "coder"
}
```

Role → picks from status:
- `coder` → `backlog`
- `reviewer` → `in_review`
- `tester` → `testing`
- `docs_writer` → `docs_needed`

### `update_task_status`
Move a task to a new status and log the transition.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "status": "in_review",
  "note": "Implementation complete, ready for review"
}
```

Valid statuses: `backlog`, `in_progress`, `in_review`, `testing`, `docs_needed`, `done`, `blocked`

### `add_task_comment`
Add a comment to a task's activity log without changing its status.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "reviewer-prime",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "comment": "Left some inline comments on the auth module"
}
```

### `create_task`
Create a new task. Agents can spawn subtasks.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "title": "Add rate limiting middleware",
  "description": "Implement token bucket rate limiting for the API",
  "priority": "high",
  "assigned_role": "coder",
  "tags": ["backend", "security"]
}
```

### `list_tasks`
Query tasks with optional filters.

```json
{
  "status": "backlog",
  "assigned_role": "coder"
}
```

### `get_task`
Get full details of a task including its complete activity log.

```json
{
  "task_id": "abc-123"
}
```

### `set_output_path`
Record the path of a file artifact produced for a task.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "output_path": "/src/middleware/rate_limit.rs"
}
```

### `heartbeat`
Update `last_seen` timestamp. Call every few minutes to stay marked as active.

```json
{ "agent_id": "coder-alpha" }
```

---

### `create_branch`
Record the git branch you created locally for a task.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "branch_name": "feature/abc12345-add-auth",
  "base_branch": "main"
}
```

### `record_commit`
Record a commit you made locally. Call after every `git commit`.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "message": "feat: implement JWT authentication"
}
```

### `request_review`
Mark work done and move to `in_review`. Returns git checkout commands for the reviewer.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "commit_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "note": "All tests passing, ready for review"
}
```

### `get_review_target`
Get the branch, commits, and ready-to-run git commands for reviewing a task.

```json
{ "task_id": "abc-123" }
```

### `approve_review`
Approve the review — moves task to `testing`.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "reviewer-prime",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "comment": "LGTM — clean implementation, good test coverage"
}
```

### `request_changes`
Request changes — moves task back to `in_progress` with feedback for the coder.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "reviewer-prime",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "feedback": "Token expiry not handled — add refresh logic in auth.rs line 42"
}
```

### `set_pr_url`
Record a pull/merge request URL.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "pr_url": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42"
}
```

### `setup_worktree`
Record the git worktree path for a task. Returns the `git worktree add` commands to run. Use this instead of (or in addition to) `create_branch` when running multiple agents concurrently — each agent gets an isolated directory to work in.

```json
{
  "agent_id": "coder-alpha",
  "task_id": "abc-123",
  "branch_name": "feature/abc12345-add-auth",
  "worktree_path": ".worktrees/feature-abc12345-add-auth",
  "base_branch": "main"
}
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "message": "Worktree recorded",
  "setup_commands": [
    "git worktree add .worktrees/feature-abc12345-add-auth -b feature/abc12345-add-auth",
    "cd .worktrees/feature-abc12345-add-auth"
  ]
}
```

## Agent System Prompts

### Coder Agent
> You are a coding agent connected to a shared task tracker with git integration. At the start of each session:
> 1. Call `register_agent` with your `agent_id` and `role: "coder"`
> 2. Call `get_next_task` — returns a task and a suggested branch name
> 3. Call `setup_worktree` with `branch_name` and `worktree_path` (e.g. `.worktrees/<branch>`) — it returns the exact `git worktree add` commands to run. This gives you an isolated working directory so other agents can work concurrently.
> 4. Run the returned `git worktree add` commands, then `cd` into the worktree path
> 5. Implement the task. After each `git commit`, call `record_commit` with the hash and message
> 6. Call `set_output_path` to record the primary file(s) you produced
> 7. Call `request_review` with your HEAD commit hash — moves the task to `in_review`
> 8. Optionally call `set_pr_url` if you opened a pull request
> 9. Repeat from step 2. Send a `heartbeat` every few minutes.

### Reviewer Agent
> You are a code reviewer agent. At the start of each session:
> 1. Call `register_agent` with your `agent_id` and `role: "reviewer"`
> 2. Call `get_next_task` — picks a task from `in_review`
> 3. Call `get_review_target` to get the branch name, commit list, and ready-to-run git commands
> 4. Call `setup_worktree` with `worktree_path: ".worktrees/<branch>-review"` to get an isolated checkout for reviewing — run the returned commands
> 5. Inspect changes: `git diff main --stat` then `git diff main`
> 6. Log findings with `add_task_comment`
> 7. If approved: call `approve_review` — moves to `testing`
> 8. If changes needed: call `request_changes` with specific feedback — moves back to `in_progress`
> 9. Run `git worktree remove .worktrees/<branch>-review` to clean up. Repeat. Send a `heartbeat` every few minutes.

### Tester Agent

> 3. Call `setup_worktree` with `worktree_path: ".worktrees/<branch>-test"` — run the returned commands to get an isolated checkout
> 4. Write and run tests. Call `record_commit` for any test commits you make
> 5. Call `set_output_path` to record your test file path
> 6. If tests pass: call `update_task_status` → `"docs_needed"` with a summary
> 7. If tests fail: call `update_task_status` → `"in_progress"` with failure details
> 8. Run `git worktree remove .worktrees/<branch>-test` to clean up. Repeat. Send a `heartbeat` every few minutes.

### Docs Writer Agent
