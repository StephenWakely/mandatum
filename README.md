# Mandatum — Multi-Agent Task Tracker

A self-contained task tracking system for coordinating AI coding agents. Exposes a full MCP server over HTTP/SSE so multiple AI agents can connect simultaneously and coordinate work via a shared kanban board. Mandatum watches the task queue and spawns agents automatically when work is available.

```

The server spawns agent processes automatically when tasks become available. Each agent handles one task and exits; the spawner fires again on the next poll cycle if more work remains.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** toolchain (stable) — [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
- **Node.js 18+** and npm — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or `nvm`
- **`claude` CLI** on `PATH` for Claude agents — [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)
- **`codex` CLI** on `PATH` for Codex agents (optional)

## Installation

```bash
cd ui && npm install && cd ..
```

Rust dependencies are fetched automatically on first build.

Add `.worktrees/` to the `.gitignore` of the repo agents will work in:

```bash
echo '.worktrees/' >> /path/to/your/project/.gitignore
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure

Edit `mandatum.yaml` at the repo root:

```yaml
project_dir: /path/to/your/project   # git repo agents work in
agents_dir: agents                    # path to agents/ scripts directory

max_concurrent: 5   # max agents per role running simultaneously
caveman: true       # terse agent responses — reduces token usage

agents:
  coder:
    type: claude    # "claude" or "codex"
    additional_instructions: ""
  reviewer:
    type: claude
  tester:
    type: claude
  docs_writer:
    type: claude
```

### 2. Build and run

```bash
make build
./server/target/release/mandatum-server \
  --ui ui/dist \
  --db tasks.db \
  --repo /path/to/your/project \
  --base-branch main
```

Open **http://localhost:3001**.

> **First build:** `make build` compiles Rust dependencies (1–2 min). Subsequent builds are fast.

### 3. Create tasks

Use the **+ New Task** button in the UI, or `POST /api/tasks` directly. As soon as a task enters the queue, the spawner detects it and launches the appropriate agent.

For larger features, use the **planner agent** to break work down into tasks with correct roles, priorities, and dependencies:

```bash
# Interactive session — describe what you want to build
agents/claude/run-planner.sh

# Pre-load a plan document and discuss it interactively
agents/claude/run-planner.sh plan.md

# Non-interactive — read a plan file and create all tasks immediately
agents/claude/run-planner.sh --auto plan.md
```

When chatting with the planner, you can ask it to optimise the dependency graph for parallelism ("make as much run in parallel as possible") or sequence ("keep it linear, one task at a time"). Dependencies control which tasks the spawner can start — a task with unresolved dependencies won't be claimed until all its dependencies reach `done`.

### Server flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--ui <path>` | `ui/dist` if present | Directory of built React app to serve |
| `--db <path>` | `tasks.db` | SQLite database path |
| `--repo <path>` | — | Git repo agents work in; enables auto-merge on task completion |
| `--base-branch <name>` | `master` | Branch to merge completed tasks into |
| `--config <path>` | `mandatum.yaml` if present | YAML agent spawner config |
| `--rest-port <port>` | `3001` | REST API and UI port |
| `--mcp-port <port>` | `3002` | MCP/SSE port |

---

## Agent Spawner

The server's built-in spawner polls the task queue every 5 seconds. When unclaimed tasks exist for a role, it spawns the configured agent script and streams its output.

### How it works

1. Spawner counts unclaimed tasks per role.
2. Spawns up to `max_concurrent - currently_running` new agents for that role.
3. Each spawned agent handles one task (`MANDATUM_ONCE=1`) then exits.
4. Output is streamed line-by-line via SSE (`agent_log` events) and written to `logs/agents/<agent-id>.log`.
5. When the agent exits, the counter decrements and the next poll may spawn again.

### Viewing agent logs

Click the terminal icon (⊟) on any agent card in the **Agents** panel to open a live log modal showing both historical and streaming output.

The log file is also readable directly:

```bash
cat logs/agents/coder-abc123de.log
# or via API:
curl http://localhost:3001/api/agents/coder-abc123de/log
```

### Configuration reference

All fields in `mandatum.yaml`:

```yaml
project_dir: .           # git repo agents work in; --repo CLI flag overrides
agents_dir: agents       # path to agents/ directory
max_concurrent: 5        # global max agents per role (default: 5)
caveman: true            # terse response mode — drops filler, reduces tokens (default: true)

agents:
  coder:
    type: claude                      # "claude" or "codex"
    additional_instructions: ""       # appended to every agent prompt for this role
    max_concurrent: 3                 # override global max for this role
    caveman: false                    # override global caveman setting for this role
  reviewer:
    type: codex
  tester:
    type: claude
  docs_writer:
    type: claude
```

---

## Running Agents Manually

The spawner handles agent lifecycle automatically when `mandatum.yaml` is configured. You can still run agents manually — useful for debugging or running agents against a different server:

```bash
# All four roles at once (Claude)
agents/claude/run-all.sh /path/to/your/project

# Individual roles
agents/claude/run-coder.sh    [agent-id] [project-dir]
agents/claude/run-reviewer.sh [agent-id] [project-dir]
agents/claude/run-tester.sh   [agent-id] [project-dir]
agents/claude/run-docs.sh     [agent-id] [project-dir]

# Same scripts for Codex
agents/codex/run-coder.sh     [agent-id] [project-dir]
# etc.
```

Manually-run scripts loop continuously — claim a task, complete it, sleep 10 s, repeat. Set `MANDATUM_ONCE=1` to exit after one task (what the spawner uses). Set `ADDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS` to inject extra text into the agent prompt.

---

## Seeding Sample Data

```bash
make seed
```

Inserts 8 tasks spread across multiple statuses and priorities, and registers 5 agents. Refresh the UI to see them.

---

## Build for Production

```bash
make build
```

Produces:
- `server/target/release/mandatum-server` — standalone binary
- `ui/dist/` — static React app (served directly by the binary)

### Single-process deployment

```bash
make serve
# or:
./server/target/release/mandatum-server --config mandatum.yaml
```

The server auto-detects `ui/dist/` and `mandatum.yaml` in the current directory, so no extra flags are needed when run from the repo root.

Open **http://localhost:3001** — both the API and the UI are served from the same port.

---

## Git Workflow

Each task maps to a git branch. The full lifecycle:

```
backlog
  → [coder]      in_progress  →  in_review
  → [reviewer]   testing (approve) or back to backlog (request_changes)
  → [tester]     docs_needed (pass) or in_progress (fail)
  → [docs_writer] done
  → [server]     auto-merge into base branch (if --repo configured)
```

### Branch naming

`get_next_task` suggests a branch name automatically:

```
feature/<first-8-chars-of-id>-<slugified-title>
```

e.g. `feature/a1b2c3d4-implement-user-authentication`

### Git worktrees

Each agent gets an isolated git worktree so multiple agents can work simultaneously on the same repo without interfering:

```
.worktrees/
  feature__a1b2c3d4-add-auth/          ← coder
  feature__a1b2c3d4-add-auth-review/   ← reviewer
  feature__a1b2c3d4-add-auth-test/     ← tester
  feature__a1b2c3d4-add-auth-docs/     ← docs writer
```

All share the same `.git` object store — no duplication of history. Add `.worktrees/` to your `.gitignore`.

### Reviewer feedback loop

If a reviewer calls `request_changes`, the task returns to the coder with feedback attached. The coder must address every feedback round before `request_review` is accepted again. The server enforces this: the resubmission note must include `Round N:` lines for each round of changes requested.

### Auto-merge

When a task moves to `done` and `--repo` is configured, the server automatically merges the task branch into the base branch and cleans up all worktrees for that branch.

---

## Connecting AI Agents via MCP

Agents connect to the MCP server at port 3002. The runner scripts handle this automatically. For manual or custom agents:

```bash
# Claude Code CLI
claude mcp add --transport http task-tracker http://localhost:3002

# Codex
codex mcp add task-tracker --url http://localhost:3002
```

JSON config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-tracker": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3002"
    }
  }
}
```

Legacy SSE clients: `http://localhost:3002/sse`

## Stale Agent Detection

The server resets tasks whose assigned agent hasn't sent a heartbeat in **10 minutes**, moving them back to their role's queue status. The background watchdog runs every 60 seconds.

Trigger manually:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/reap
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/tasks/<id>/reset
```

The UI shows a stale warning on agent cards that haven't been seen in 5 minutes, and a **Reset** button inside the task modal.
